# Discord DMs Cloner

A tool to automatiqually clone the DMs you receive to a seperate server for archiving and preservation purposes. Note that using this tool could possibly put your account in risk of getting banned, as selfbotting is technically against Discord's guidelines.

## Installation

I'll get into filling this out later, stay tuned.
